# localweb

This is my first big project. This application is kind of messanger, like Skype. The idea was to use in practice Qt framework, get some experience of networking programming, implement my own client-server architecture system.

Of course, as I want to do many things by myself, I tried to do no use any libraries and implement many "vehicle" things :)) I did implement any encoding to compress media data :)) so this project is still very row.

But for the first big project, I think it was very good. I've got many expirience doing it :)
