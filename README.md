# localweb

This is my first big project. This application is kind of messanger, like Skype. The idea was to use in practice Qt framework, get some experience of networking programming, implement my own client-server architecture system, get experience with some computer periphery as Web-camera.

Of course, as I wanted to do many things by myself, I tried to do no use any libraries and implement many "vehicle" things :)) I did not implement any encoding to compress media data :)) so this project is still very raw.

As I remember, I implemented next features: private and group text messaging, files tranfer, voice and video call. As the name suggests, it works in local networks.

But for the first big project, I think it was very good. I got many expirience doing it :)
